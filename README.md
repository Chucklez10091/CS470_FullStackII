# CS470_FullStackII

**Experiences and Strengths: Explain how this course will help you in reaching your professional goals.
What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**
  The aws, containerization, and general next-step full-stack development skills I learned in this course have given me a lot of confidence in starting small projects of my own to add to my portfolio while job-searching. Understanding better a second (and how to learn a third with google services) way to deploy/develop a web application is incredibly helpful.
  
**Describe your strengths as a software developer.
Identify the types of roles you are prepared to assume in a new job.**
  I believe my greatest strengths to be my adaptability and resource management. I'm eager to learn what I don't already know, and am happy to both search self-reliantly or to leverage the expertise of those around me to improve my projects. That said, I believe I'm fairly well equipped to assume full-stack dev, backend dev, or data management/analysis roles, or even front-end with a little time to get more familiar with css.

**How would you predict the cost?
What is more cost predictable, containers or serverless?
Explain several pros and cons that would be deciding factors in plans for expansion.
What roles do elasticity and pay-for-service play in decision making for planned future growth?**
  Predicting cost would depend on the model. Containers and native servers require estimating probable traffic/capacity needs, then extrapolating based on the cost of the servers, up-time, and maintenance overheads needed to satisfy that capacity. Serverless pricing models I imagine would be best predicted by reviewing data from QA/testing traffic and comparing that to expected capacity requirements, though the lack of constants beyond the avg cost per user make this somewhat difficult. Containers are inherently more predictable cost-wise as the developer dictates the budget when planning capacity, and that budget gets spent when purchasing/deploying servers. Serverless is less predictable as it depends on demand, though an appropriate pricing/monetization model for the application/company should result in appropriate margins as long as usage is within reasonable lower-bounds.
